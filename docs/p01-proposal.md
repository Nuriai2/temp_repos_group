## **Introduction**
In the alarming growth in the expenses of resources becoming expensive, we have decided to report a project based on the current economic situation. The limited resources being a concern after the hit of Covid-19 has created a global surge in prices. This was due to the result of political desicions and supply and demand of resources. Due to the current outcome, we have decide to create a project that reflects in the current trends and cultures in retrospective of the high living standards. The information provided in this report comes from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as [kraggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clkmuhammed/creditscoreclassification?resource=download) showcasing the information in the current work force. In addition of the information, we are hoping to showcase the changes and current work flow to the general public.


## **Problem Domain**
With the appearance of Covid-19, it lead to a drastic hit in the economy as many people lack secruity in their jobs due to companies insueing layoffs. Job growth remaing slow, hours cut, instability in jobs, and overall lost in wages. The Census Bereau released data on the job market at the end of 2021, and it was noted that tens of millions of people lost their jobs ([CBPP](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-economys-effects-on-food-housing-and#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20and,unemployment%20remained%20high%20throughout%202020.)). This had resulted in many relief programs being active. Nevertheless, 20 million households did not have enough to eat and 10 million being behing in house payments. The [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)] recorded the changes in major worker groups in September:


<br>

> 1) The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 306,000 to 3.8 million in September
> 2) The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at 5.8 million in September and remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million
> 3) Among the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers decreased by 173,000 to 1.2 million in September
> 4) The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, increased by 119,000 to 485,000 in September.

The pandemic impacted everyone but was not distributed evenly to all social classes. In fact, it remained more prevalent in groups such as Blacks, Latinos, and other groups of minority. This is the result due to structual racism shifting the most economic hardships to those of color.
> Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics decreased to 3.8 percent in September. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.1 percent), teenagers (11.4
percent), Whites (3.1 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Asians (2.5 percent) showed little change over the month


## **Research Questions**

1) How has the the workforce in groups of minority been impacted?
2) What are the current trends/culture of each standing social classes?
3) How did Covid-19 affected finance in the long term?

## **The Dataset**

The dataset details a lot of information related to finance specifically credit scores. It gives data related to credit score, SSN, occupation, individual base salaries and number of bank accounts a person has. All of this data is helpful to our project because it helps us see how credit scores differ based on socioeconomic status and one way to determine that is through knowing occupation.

## **Limitations**
One thing that the data table fail to acomodate is the area of living. As some areas have low or high financial needs of living, it can have an effect on the statistics and general making desicions in
classifying the social classes. Data does lack a few information to find solutions for the problem domain. May have to find data that is more fitting.
